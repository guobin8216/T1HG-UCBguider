# T1HG-UCBguider
Machine learning model construction was performed silimilarly as previously described (PMID: 34875674), the 18 mRNA markers and 7 MHB markers were integrated with 4 clinical variables (age, gender, tumor stage, and grade) to construct two machine learning sub-models within the T1HG-UCBguider framework.
